Lets sort the given array.

As we have to add each man to exactly one group, we can start the process from man at first position. 
If we start making 1 group from position i, we can include man of position until j, 
where distance from j person to i is less of equal to 2*k and j-i+1 >= 3.

Now, in a recursive approach, at any position i, we can choose until position j, where j starts from i+2 and ends when distance of j from i becomes
greater than 2*k (2*k as they will meet in middle position).
Thus we need to iterate for each position, which leads to a complexity of O(n^2).

To optimize this solution, we can think of an observation. Suppose we have man in position 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 & 6 and k = 2. we can take man from 1 to 5
in the same group as it satisfies the conditions. But man 6 is left alone. If we want to assign him in a group, the best choise can be to group up
with man 4 & 5 (we can probably take more, but not needed). then if remaining members of 1st group (1, 2 & 3) forms a valid group.
If there is also a man at 7 position and k = 2 remains. we only need to transfer the last person (at position 6) from first group to second group for
a valid formation.
If there is also a man at 8 position and k = 2 remains, we don't need to transfer any man from first group to second group as we can make a valid
group of man 6, 7 & 8.

From this observation, we can see that, we only needs three options from an starting postion, i. that is, if j is the last position within distance
2*k from i, then we can take calc(i) = min(calc(j+1)+1, calc(j)+1, calc(j-1)+1). [for a group starting at position i]

Thus we have a complexity of O(nlogn) after memorization in dp array, where n for each possible starting position and logn for finding last valid
position j for each valid position of longest distance with a binary search.
